/**
 * Defines a contract state.
 * <p>
 * A contract state (or just "state") contains opaque data used by a contract program. It can be thought of as a disk
 * file that the program can use to persist data across transactions.
 * <p>
 * States are immutable. Once created, they are never updated, instead, any changes must generate a new successor state.
 * States can be updated (consumed) only once. The notary is responsible for ensuring there is no "double spending" by
 * only signing a transaction if the input states are all free.
