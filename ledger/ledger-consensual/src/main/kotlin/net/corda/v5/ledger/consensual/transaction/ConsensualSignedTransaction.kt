/**
 * Defines a signed Consensual transaction.
 *
 *  Comparing with [ConsensualLedgerTransaction]:
 *  - It does not have access to the deserialized details.
 *  - It has direct access to the signatures.
 *  - It does not require a serializer.
 *
 * [ConsensualSignedTransaction] wraps the wire representation of the transaction. It contains one or more signatures,
 * each one for a public key (including composite keys) that is mentioned inside a transaction state.
 * [ConsensualSignedTransaction] is frequently passed around the network and stored. The identity of a transaction is
 * the hash of Merkle root of the wrapped wire representation, therefore if you are storing data keyed by wire
 * representations hash be aware that multiple different [ConsensualSignedTransaction]s may map to the same key (and
 * they could be different in important ways, like validity!). The signatures on a ConsensualSignedTransaction
 * might be invalid or missing: the type does not imply validity.
 * A transaction ID should be the hash of the wrapped wire representation's Merkle tree root.
 * Thus adding or removing a signature does not change it.
