 * Defines a consensual state.

 * A consensual state (or just "state") contains opaque data used by a consensual ledger. It can be thought of as a
 * disk file that the program can use to persist data across transactions. They are immutable, and can never be
 * consumed. Once created, they are never updated, instead, any changes must generate a new successor state.
