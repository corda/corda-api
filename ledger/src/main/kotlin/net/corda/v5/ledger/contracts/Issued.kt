/**
 * The [Issued] data class holds the details of an on ledger digital asset.
 * In particular it gives the public credentials of the entity that created these digital tokens
 * and the particular product represented.
 *
 * @param P the class type of product underlying the definition, for example [java.util.Currency].
 * @property issuer The [AbstractParty] details of the entity which issued the asset
 * and a reference blob, which can contain other details related to the token creation e.g. serial number,
 * warehouse location, etc.
 * The issuer is the gatekeeper for creating, or destroying the tokens on the digital ledger and
 * only their [PrivateKey] signature can authorise transactions that do not conserve the total number
 * of tokens on the ledger.
 * Other identities may own the tokens, but they can only create transactions that conserve the total token count.
 * Typically the issuer is also a well know organisation that can convert digital tokens to external assets
 * and thus underwrites the digital tokens.
 * Different issuer values may coexist for a particular product, but these cannot be merged.
 * @property product The details of the specific product represented by these digital tokens. The value
 * of product may differentiate different kinds of asset within the same logical class e.g the currency, or
 * it may just be a type marker for a single custom asset.
