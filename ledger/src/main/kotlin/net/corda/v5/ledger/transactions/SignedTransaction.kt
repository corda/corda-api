/**
 * SignedTransaction wraps a serialized WireTransaction. It contains one or more signatures, each one for
 * a public key (including composite keys) that is mentioned inside a transaction command. SignedTransaction is the top level transaction type
 * and the type most frequently passed around the network and stored. The identity of a transaction is the hash of Merkle root
 * of a WireTransaction, therefore if you are storing data keyed by WT hash be aware that multiple different STs may
 * map to the same key (and they could be different in important ways, like validity!). The signatures on a
 * SignedTransaction might be invalid or missing: the type does not imply validity.
 * A transaction ID should be the hash of the [WireTransaction] Merkle tree root. Thus adding or removing a signature does not change it.
