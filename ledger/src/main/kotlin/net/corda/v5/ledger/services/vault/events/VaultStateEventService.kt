/**

    /**
     * Subscribe to vault events and execute the given [function] using each [VaultStateEvent]. These events are emitted when states are
     * produced or consumed (saved to the vault as output or input states).
     *
     * Subscription using this method is reliable, meaning all events will eventually be processed even if the process crashes. To achieve
     * this behaviour, this method must be executed when the Corda process is restarted. The consistent lifecycle of [CordaService]s
     * provides a safe location to execute [subscribe].
     *
     * This overload of [subscribe] provides a fully managed solution, that moves the position of processed [VaultStateEvent]s after each
     * event is processed. For more control over the position of processed events, see the overload of [subscribe] that returns a
     * [DurableCursor].
     *
     * Uncaught exceptions thrown within the provided [function] are caught within the platform code. When this happens the subscriber will
     * continue onto the next event and update its position, meaning that the event will never be processed again by the subscriber.
     *
     * Example usage within a [CordaService]:
     *
     * - Kotlin:
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * class LoggingVaultEventSubscriber : CordaService {
     *
     *     @CordaInjectPreStart
     *     private lateinit var vaultEventService: VaultEventService
     *
     *     override fun onEvent(event: ServiceEvent) {
     *         if (event == ServiceLifecycleEvent.SERVICE_START) {
     *             vaultEventService.subscribe("Logging vault event subscriber") { deduplicationId, vaultEvent ->
     *                 log.info("Processing value: $vaultEvent with deduplication id: $deduplicationId")
     *             }
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * - Java:
     *
     * ```java
     * public class LoggingVaultEventSubscriber implements CordaService {
     *
     *     @CordaInjectPreStart
     *     private VaultEventService vaultEventService;
     *
     *     @Override

     *         if (event == ServiceLifecycleEvent.SERVICE_START) {
     *             vaultEventService.subscribe("Logging vault event subscriber", (deduplicationId, vaultEvent) -> {

     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * [ServiceLifecycleEvent.STATE_MACHINE_STARTED] should be used instead of [ServiceLifecycleEvent.SERVICE_START] if flows are being
     * started from within [subscribe]'s [function].
     *
     * @param name The name of the subscriber. This name __must be unique__ per subscriber and cursor as it used to maintain the position of
     * processed events.
     * @param function The [BiConsumer] that is executed for each [VaultStateEvent] output from the vault. The provided [Long] value is a
     * deduplication id to use for deduplication purposes.
     *
     * @throws CordaRuntimeException If the provided [name] already belongs to another cursor or subscriber.
     *

     * Subscription using this method provides full control over the retrieval and processing of events. Events must be polled and the
