/**
 * <p>The member information consists of two parts; The member provided context which consists of parameters added and
 * signed by member as part of the initial MemberInfo proposal, and the MGM provided context which consists of
 * parameters added by MGM as a part of member acceptance.</p>
 *
 * <p>Internally visible properties are accessible via extension properties.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example usages:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Java:<pre>{@code
 * MGMContext mgmContext = memberInfo.getMgmProvidedContext();
 * MemberContext memberContext = memberInfo.getMemberProvidedContext();
 * MemberX500Name x500Name = memberInfo.getName();
 * List<PublicKey> ledgerKeys = memberInfo.getLedgerKeys();
 * Long serial = memberInfo.getSerial();
 * int platformVersion = memberInfo.getPlatformVersion();
 * PublicKey sessionKey = memberInfo.getSessionInitiationKey();
 * Boolean isActive = memberInfo.isActive();
 * }</pre></li>
 * <li>Kotlin:<pre>{@code
 * val mgmContext: MGMContext = memberInfo.mgmProvidedContext
 * val memberContext: MemberContext = memberInfo.memberProvidedContext
 * val x500Name: MemberX500Name = memberInfo.name
 * val ledgerKeys: kotlin.collections.List<PublicKey> = memberInfo.ledgerKeys
