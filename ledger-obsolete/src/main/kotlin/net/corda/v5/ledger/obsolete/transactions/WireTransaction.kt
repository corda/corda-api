/**
 * A transaction ready for serialisation, without any signatures attached. A WireTransaction is usually wrapped
 * by a [SignedTransaction] that carries the signatures over this payload.
 * The identity of the transaction is the Merkle tree root of its components (see [MerkleTree]).
 *
 * For privacy purposes, each part of a transaction should be accompanied by a nonce.
 * To avoid storing a random number (nonce) per component, an initial [privacySalt] is the sole value utilised,
 * so that all component nonces are deterministically computed.
 *
 * A few notes about backwards compatibility:
 * A wire transaction can be backwards compatible, in the sense that if an old client receives a [componentGroups] with
 * more elements than expected, it will normally deserialise the required objects and omit any checks in the optional
 * new fields. Moreover, because the Merkle tree is constructed from the received list of [ComponentGroup], which internally
 * deals with bytes, any client can compute the Merkle tree and on the same time relay a [WireTransaction] object even
 * if she is unable to read some of the "optional" component types. We stress that practically, a new type of
 * [WireTransaction] should only be considered compatible if and only if the following rules apply:
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>Component-type ordering is fixed (eg. inputs, then outputs, then commands etc, see [ComponentGroupEnum][net.corda.v5.ledger.obsolete.contracts.ComponentGroupEnum] for the actual ordering).
 * <li>Removing a component-type that existed in older wire transaction types is not allowed, because it will affect the Merkle tree structure.
 * <li>Changing the order of existing component types is also not allowed, for the same reason.
 * <li>New component types must be added at the end of the list of [ComponentGroup] and update the [ComponentGroupEnum][net.corda.v5.ledger.obsolete.contracts.ComponentGroupEnum] with the new type. After a component is added, its ordinal must never change.
 * <li>A new component type should always be an "optional value", in the sense that lack of its visibility does not change the transaction and contract logic and details. An example of "optional" components could be a transaction summary or some statistics.
 * </ul></p>
