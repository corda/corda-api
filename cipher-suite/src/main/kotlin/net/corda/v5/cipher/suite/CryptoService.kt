/**
 * Crypto service which can sign as well as create new key pairs.
 *
 * Note about key aliases. Corda always uses single alias to identify a key pair however some HSMs need separate
 * aliases for public and private keys, in such cases their names have to be derived from the single key pair alias.
 * It could be suffixes or whatever internal naming scheme is used.
 *
 * Also note that it is not required to keep a public key in the HSM as that will be kept by the upstream Crypto Services.
 *
 * Exception handling.
 *
 * As the service instances are decorated with decorators taking care of the timeout, throttling handling,
 * and exception normalisation the exceptions listed for each method bellow are as expected to be thrown by the decorators.
 *
 * The service should throw the most appropriate exception as it sees it, e.g.:
 * - [net.corda.v5.crypto.exceptions.CryptoKeyNotFoundException] if the key is not found
 * - [net.corda.v5.crypto.exceptions.CryptoKeySchemeUnsupportedException] if the key scheme is not supported
 * - [net.corda.v5.crypto.exceptions.CryptoSignatureSpecUnsupportedException] if the signature spec is not supported
 * - if the input parameters are wrong it should be [IllegalArgumentException]
 * - if the internal state is wrong for an operation then the most appropriate exception would be [IllegalStateException]
 * - any other what is appropriate for the condition.
 *
 * If service encountered throttling situation and the downstream library doesn't handle that then it should throw one
 * of concrete implementations of [net.corda.v5.crypto.exceptions.CryptoThrottlingException]
 * (such as [net.corda.v5.crypto.exceptions.CryptoExponentialThrottlingException]) so the upstream service
 * can handle it appropriately.
 *
 * The following exceptions are retried - [java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException],
 * [net.corda.v5.crypto.exceptions.CryptoException] (with the isRecoverable flag set to true),
 * some persistence exceptions like [javax.persistence.LockTimeoutException], [javax.persistence.QueryTimeoutException],
 * [javax.persistence.OptimisticLockException], [javax.persistence.PessimisticLockException] and some others.
 * Throw [java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException] only if the service want's that to be handled before
 * the upstream library detects it.
