 * The annotated entity should have more restricted visibility but needs to be visible for tests.

 * This annotation is to be used on any class, method or property that needs package or public visibilty
 * purely for testing purposes, and should only be used internally in production code.
 * Technically, it has no effect on the code. There is no mechanism to enforce that the annotated entity is only used
 * where it is intended to be used. It is purely a marker that the visibility of the annotated entity is chosen for
 * testing purposes, and it should not be relied upon for API purposes.
