/**
 * Interface for supporting Map<String, String> structure.
 * Has the required functions for converting and parsing the String values to Objects.
 *
 * The layered property map provides simple conversions to a posiibly complex objects which can use sevearl keys in
 * dot-notation. Take as an example of the map:
 *
 * "corda.name" to "CN=me, O=R3, L=Dublin, C=Ireland",
 * "corda.sessionKey" to "ABCDEF...",
 * "corda.endpoints.0.url" to "localhost",
 * "corda.endpoints.0.protocolVersion" to "1",
 * "corda.endpoints.1.url" to "localhost",
 * "corda.endpoints.1.protocolVersion" to "2"
 *
 * That map can be parsed into:
 * - MemberX500Name using parse("corda.name", MemberX500Name::class.java)
 * - session PublicKey using parse("corda.sessionKey", PublicKey::class.java)
 * - list of endpoints using parseList("corda.endpoints", EndpointInfo::class.java)
 *
 * The default implementation of the [LayeredPropertyMap] is extendable by supplying implementations of custom
 * converters using OSGi. Out of box it supports conversion to simple types like Int, Boolean,
 * as well as MemberX500Name.
