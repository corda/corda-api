/**
 * Interface for supporting Map<String, String> structure.
 * Has the required functions for converting and parsing the String values to Objects.
 *
 * The layered property map provides simple conversions to a possibly complex objects which can use several keys in
 * dot-notation. Take as an example of the map:
 *
 * - "corda.name" to "CN=me, O=R3, L=Dublin, C=Ireland",
 * - "corda.sessionKey" to "ABCDEF...",
 * - "corda.endpoints.0.url" to "localhost",
 * - "corda.endpoints.0.protocolVersion" to "1",
 * - "corda.endpoints.1.url" to "localhost",
 * - "corda.endpoints.1.protocolVersion" to "2"
 *
 * That map can be parsed into:
 * - MemberX500Name using parse("corda.name", MemberX500Name::class.java)
 * - session PublicKey using parse("corda.sessionKey", PublicKey::class.java)
 * - list of endpoints using parseList("corda.endpoints", EndpointInfo::class.java)
 *
 * Example usages:
 *
 * ```java
 * Set<Map.Entry<String, String>> entries = propertyMap.getEntries();
 * String groupId = propertyMap.parse("corda.groupId", String.class);
 * Instant modifiedTime = propertyMap.parseOrNull("corda.modifiedTime", Instant.class);
 * Set<String> additionalInformation = propertyMap.parseSet("additional.names", String.class);
 * List<EndpointInfo> endpoints = propertyMap.parseList("corda.endpoints", EndpointInfo.class);
 * ```
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val entries = propertyMap.entries
 * val groupId = propertyMap.parse("corda.groupId", String::class.java)
 * val modifiedTime = propertyMap.parseOrNull("corda.modifiedTime", Instant::class.java)
 * val additionalInformation = propertyMap.parseSet("additional.names", String::class.java)
 * val endpoints = propertyMap.parseList("corda.endpoints", EndpointInfo::class.java)
 * ```
 *
 * The default implementation of the [LayeredPropertyMap] is extendable by supplying implementations of custom
 * converters using OSGi. Out of box it supports conversion to simple types like Int, Boolean,
 * as well as [MemberX500Name].
 *
 * @property entries Returns [Set] of all entries in the underlying map.
