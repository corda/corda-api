 * Future versions of Corda may add new methods to such interfaces and
 * classes, but will not remove or modify existing methods.
 * Adding new methods does not break Corda's API compatibility guarantee because applications
 * should not implement or extend anything annotated with [DoNotImplement]. These classes are
 * only meant to be implemented by Corda itself.
