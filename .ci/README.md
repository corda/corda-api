# !! DO NOT MODIFY THE API FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY !!

The `api-current.txt` file contains a summary of Corda's current public APIs,
as generated by the `api-scanner` Gradle plugin. (See [here](https://github.com/corda/corda-gradle-plugins/blob/master/api-scanner/README.md) for a detailed description of this plugin.) It will be regenerated and the copy in this repository updated by the Release Manager with
each new Corda release. It will not be modified otherwise except under special circumstances that will require extra approval.

Deleting or changing the existing Corda APIs listed in `api-current.txt` may
break developers' CorDapps in the next Corda release! Please remember that we
have committed to API Stability for CorDapps.
