    For now, the crypto_signing_key table that must be identical between the cluster schema (i.e.
    that specified by this file) and the virtual node schema (specified by ../vnode-crypto/db.changelog-master.xml),
    since the crypto processor uses the same code irrespective of where the table resides.
    
    We could just include the same changeset files in both cases, but that might confuse readers
    and liquibase, so instead we have to keep the content in sync.
