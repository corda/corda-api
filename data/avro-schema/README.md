## Avro Code Source Files

All Avro definitions should go under `src/main/resources/avro`.  While technically
not necessary, it would also be good to put them under the same directory structure as 
the package (or `namespace` in Avro-speak) that the record will belong.

For details on what records you can define using Avro see:

- [Getting Started](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/gettingstartedjava.html)
- [Specification](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html)

For details on Schema Evolution (or adding/removing from a message across versions) see:

 - [Schema Resolution](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.1/specification/#schema-resolution)

## Generating Avro Code

In order to create any new classes for Avro messaging you will need to invoke
the gradle task `generateAvro`.  This will (re)create the classes in `src/main/java`.

Additionally, you will want to run `generateOSGiPackageInfo`, which will ensure that all code
generated Avro classes are correctly exposed to OSGi.

Both tasks will be run when you `assemble`/`build` your project.
