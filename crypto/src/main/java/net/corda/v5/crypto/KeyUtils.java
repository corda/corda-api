     * <p/>
     * For simple non-compound public keys, this operation simply checks if the first argument occurs in the

     * That is why if any of the <code>otherKeys</code> is a {@link CompositeKey}, this function will not 
     * find a match, though composite keys in the <code>otherKeys</code> set is not regarded as an error; they
     * are silently ignored.
     * <p/>
     * The notion of a key being in a set is about equality, which is not the same as whether one key is 
     * fulfilled by another key. For example, a {@link CompositeKey} C could be defined to have threshold 2 and:
     * </p>

     * </ul>
     * Then we would find that <code>isKeyInSet(C, X)</code> is true, but X would not fulfill C since C is fulilled by
     * X and Y together but not X on its. However, <code>isKeyInSet(C, Z)</code> is true, and Z fulfills C by itself.
