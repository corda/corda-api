/**
 * A tree data structure that enables the representation of composite public keys, which are used to represent
 * the signing requirements for multi-signature scenarios. A composite key is a list
 * of leaf keys and their contributing weight, and each leaf can be a conventional single key or a composite key.
 * Keys contribute their weight to the total if they are matched by the signature.
 * <p>
 * For complex scenarios, such as <em>"Both Alice and Bob need to sign to consume a state S"</em>, we can represent
 * the requirement by creating a tree with a root {@link CompositeKey}, and <code>Alice</code> and <code>Bob</code> as children.
 * The root node would specify <strong>weights</strong> for each of its children and a <strong>threshold</strong> –
 * the minimum total weight required (e.g. the minimum number of child signatures required) to satisfy the
 * tree signature requirement.
 * <p>
 * Using these constructs we can express e.g. 1 of N (OR) or N of N (AND) signature requirements. By nesting we can
 * create multi-level requirements such as <em>"either the CEO or 3 of 5 of his assistants need to sign"</em>.
 * <p>
 * Composite key implementations will track the minimum total weight required (in the simple case – the minimum number of child
 * signatures required) to satisfy the subtree rooted at this node.
