/*
 * [FlowMessaging] allows a flow to initiate and communicate with one or more 3rd party flows.
 *
 * The platform will provide an instance of [FlowMessaging] to flows via property injection.
 *
 * A [Flow] can initiate one or more flows other counterparties within the network, when a new flow is initiated a
 * [FlowSession] is created. The [FlowSession] represents the connection to an initiated flow and can be used to send
 * and receive data between the two flows.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * - Kotlin:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * class MyFlow : RPCStartableFlow {
 *    @CordaInject
 *    lateinit var flowMessaging: FlowMessaging
 *
 *    override fun call(requestBody: RPCRequestData): String {
 *        val counterparty = parse("CN=Alice, O=Alice Corp, L=LDN, C=GB")
 *
 *        val session = flowMessaging.initiateFlow(counterparty)
 *
 *        val result = session.sendAndReceive<String>("hello")
 *
 *        session.close()
 *
 *        return result.unwrap { it }
 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * - Java:
 *
 * ```java
 * class MyFlow implements RPCStartableFlow {
 *
 *    @CordaInject
 *    public FlowMessaging flowMessaging;
 *
 *    @Override
 *    public String call(RPCRequestData requestBody) {
 *        MemberX500Name counterparty = MemberX500Name.parse("CN=Alice, O=Alice Corp, L=LDN, C=GB");
 *        FlowSession session = flowMessaging.initiateFlow(counterparty);
 *
 *        UntrustworthyData<String> result = session.sendAndReceive(String.class, "hello");
 *
 *        session.close();
 *
 *        return result.unwrap(x -> x);
 *    }
 *}
 * ```

     *
     * Initiated flows are initiated with context based on the context of the initiating flow at the point in time this
     * method is called. The context of the initiating flow is snapshotted by the returned session. Altering the flow
     * context has no effect on the context of the session after this point, and therefore it has no effect on the
     * context of the initiated flow either.

     *
     * This overload takes a builder of context properties. Any properties set or modified against the context passed to
     * this builder will be propagated to initiated flows and all that flow's initiated flows and sub flows down the
     * stack. The properties passed to the builder are pre-populated with the current flow context properties, see
