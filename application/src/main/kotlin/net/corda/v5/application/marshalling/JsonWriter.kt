/**
 * An interface to a creator of Json. Part of the support to add custom serializer support to the
 * [JsonMarshallingService]. Custom serializers are passed a [JsonWriter] in order they can translate their object
 * types to Json.
 *
 * When writing arrays and objects, methods which denote the start and end are provided, which should enclose calls to
 * write any content within those arrays or objects. The root of the Json being serialized should always start with a
 * call to [writeStartObject] and end with a call to [writeEndObject]. Arrays of course can only contain values, not
 * fields. Objects must contain fields and values. Separators between objects, arrays, and array items are automatically
 * added.
 *
 * When fields and values are written with either two method calls or the single methods which take a field name and
 * value parameter, the separators and enclosing double quotation marks are added automatically. The [JsonWriter] will
 * throw if you attempt to write values without field names, the exception being the [writeRaw] methods which dump
 * whatever you pass directly into the Json output unchanged. To write raw content with validation instead call one of
 * the [writeRawValue] methods, which will assume whatever is passed is a valid Json value.
