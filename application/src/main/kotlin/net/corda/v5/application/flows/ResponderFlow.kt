 * [ResponderFlow] is a [Flow] that is started by receiving a message from a peer.

 * session is created by the platform and communicates with the party that initiated the session.
 *
 * Flows implementing this interface must have a no-arg constructor. The flow invocation will fail if this constructor
 * does not exist.
