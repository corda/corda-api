/**
 * This annotation is required by any [FlowLogic] which has been designated to initiate communication with a counterparty
 * and request they start their side of the flow communication.
 *
 * There is also an optional [version] property, which defaults to 1, to specify the version of the flow protocol. This
 * integer value should be incremented whenever there is a release of this flow which has changes that are not backwards
 * compatible with previous releases. This may be a change in the sends and receives that occur, or it could be a change
 * in what a send or receive means, etc.
 *
 * The version is used when a flow first initiates communication with a party to inform them of the version they are using.
 * If the other side does not have this flow registered with the same version then the initiation request will be rejected.
 * Currently only one version of the same flow can be registered by a node.
 *
 * The flow version number is similar in concept to Corda's platform version but they are not the same. A flow's version
 * number can change independently of the platform version.
 *
 * If you are customising an existing initiating flow by sub-classing it then there's no need to specify this annotation
 * again. In fact doing so is an error and checks are made to make sure this doesn't occur.
