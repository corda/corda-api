 * This annotation is required by any [FlowLogic] that is designed to be initiated by a counterparty flow. The class must
 * have at least a constructor which takes in a single [net.corda.v5.application.identity.Party] parameter which represents the
 * initiating counterparty. The [FlowLogic] that does the initiating is specified by the [value] property and itself must be annotated
 * with [InitiatingFlow].
 *
 * The node on startup scans for [FlowLogic]s which are annotated with this and automatically registers the initiating
 * to initiated flow mapping.
