/**
 * Mark a flow as initiated, meaning it is started as a consequence of a counterparty requesting a new session.
 *
 * Any flows that participate in flow sessions must declare a protocol name. The platform will use the protocol name to
 * establish what flow to invoke on the responder side when the initiator side creates a session. For example, to set up
 * a basic initiator-responder pair, you'd declare the following:
 *
 *
 * ```
 *   @InitiatingFlow(protocol = "myprotocol")
 *   class MyFlowInitiator : Flow {
 *    ...
 *   }
 *
 *   @InitiatedBy(protocol = "myprotocol")
 *   class MyFlowResponder : ResponderFlow {
 *    ...
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * Flows may also optionally declare a range of protocol versions they support. By default, flows support protocol
 * version 1 only. When initiating a flow, the platform will look for the highest supported protocol version as declared
 * on the initiating side and start that flow on the responder side. You can use the `FlowInfo` object on the session to
 * discover what protocol version is currently in operation for the session and switch behaviour accordingly.
 *
 * Note that responder flows are not eligible to be started via RPC.
 *
