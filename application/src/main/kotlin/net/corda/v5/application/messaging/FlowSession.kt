/**
 * A [FlowSession] is a handle on a communication sequence between two paired flows, possibly running on separate nodes.
 *
 * It is used to send and receive messages between the flows as well as to query information about the counter-flow.
 * Sessions have their own local flow context which can be accessed via the [contextProperties] property. Note that the
 * parent context is snapshotted at the point the [contextProperties] is first accessed, after which no other changes to
 * the parent context will be reflected in them, see [contextProperties] for more information.
 *
 * There are two ways of obtaining such a session:
 *
 * 1. Calling [FlowMessaging.initiateFlow]. This will create a [FlowSession] object on which the first send/receive
 * operation will attempt to kick off a corresponding [ResponderFlow] flow on the counterpart's node.
 *
 * 2. As constructor parameter to [ResponderFlow] flows. This session is the one corresponding to the initiating flow
 * and may be used for replies.
 *
 * @see FlowMessaging
