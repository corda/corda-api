/**
 * A {@link FlowSession} is a handle on a communication sequence between two paired flows, possibly running on separate nodes.
 * <p>
 * It is used to send and receive messages between the flows as well as to query information about the counter-flow.
 * Sessions have their own local flow context which can be accessed via {@link #getContextProperties}. Note that the
 * parent context is snapshotted at the point {@link #getContextProperties} is first accessed, after which no other changes to
 * the parent context will be reflected in them. See {@link #getContextProperties} for more information.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways of obtaining such a session:
 * <ol><li>Calling {@link FlowMessaging#initiateFlow}. This will create a {@link FlowSession} object on which the first send/receive
 * operation will attempt to kick off a corresponding {@link ResponderFlow} flow on the counterpart's node.</li>
 * <li>As constructor parameter to {@link ResponderFlow} flows. This session is the one corresponding to the initiating flow
 * and may be used for replies.</li></ol>
