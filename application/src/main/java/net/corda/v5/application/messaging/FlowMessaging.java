/*
 * {@link FlowMessaging} allows a flow to initiate and communicate with one or more 3rd party flows.
 *
 * The platform will provide an instance of {@link FlowMessaging} to flows via property injection.
 *
 * A {@link Flow} can initiate one or more flows other counterparties within the network, when a new flow is initiated a
 * {@link FlowSession} is created. The {@link FlowSession} represents the connection to an initiated flow and can be used to send
 * and receive data between the two flows.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Kotlin:
 * <pre>
 * class MyFlow : RPCStartableFlow {
 *    @CordaInject
 *    lateinit var flowMessaging: FlowMessaging
 *
 *    override fun call(requestBody: RPCRequestData): String {
 *        val counterparty = parse("CN=Alice, O=Alice Corp, L=LDN, C=GB")
 *
 *        val session = flowMessaging.initiateFlow(counterparty)
 *
 *        val result = session.sendAndReceive<String>("hello")
 *
 *        session.close()
 *
 *        return result
 *    }
 *  }
 * </pre></li>
 * <li>Java:
 * <pre>
 * class MyFlow implements RPCStartableFlow {
 *
 *    @CordaInject
 *    public FlowMessaging flowMessaging;
 *
 *    @Override
 *    public String call(RPCRequestData requestBody) {
 *        MemberX500Name counterparty = MemberX500Name.parse("CN=Alice, O=Alice Corp, L=LDN, C=GB");
 *        FlowSession session = flowMessaging.initiateFlow(counterparty);
 *
 *        String result = session.sendAndReceive(String.class, "hello");
 *
 *        session.close();
 *
 *        return result;
 *    }
 *}
 * </pre></li>
 * </ol>

     * This overload takes a builder of context properties. Any properties set or modified against the context passed to
